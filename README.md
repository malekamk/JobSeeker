Imagine a world where your job search is streamlined with cutting-edge technology that understands your skills and matches them to the perfect opportunities. **JobSeeker** makes that vision a reality!

## üîç What is JobSeeker?

**JobSeeker** is a sophisticated job matching and career recommendation platform that uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Our system doesn't just parse resumes and job descriptions‚Äîit truly understands them to provide you with the best job recommendations.

### üåü Key Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Extracts and analyzes crucial skills and experiences from resumes.
- **Job Description Parsing:** Decodes job descriptions to identify key requirements.
- **Skill Matching:** Matches your skills against job requirements using advanced algorithms.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Offers personalized job recommendations tailored to your skills and experiences.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a seamless experience with our intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backbone of our system.
- **spaCy**: For powerful NLP and skill extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: To power our matching algorithms and vectorization.
- **NLTK**: For enhanced text processing and tokenization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array management.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point of the application. Runs the job recommendation process.
- **`ResumeParser.py`**: Contains the `ResumeParser` class for extracting skills and experiences from resumes.
- **`JobDescriptionParser.py`**: Contains the `JobDescriptionParser` class for parsing job descriptions.
- **`MatchingAlgorithm.py`**: Implements the algorithm for matching resumes with job descriptions.
- **`RecommendationEngine.py`**: Provides recommendations based on the matching algorithm.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the dependencies needed for the project.

## üìù How It Works

**JobSeeker** employs a streamlined approach to job matching through the following components:

1. **Resume Parsing**: 
   - The `ResumeParser` class extracts key skills and experiences from your resume. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and process the text, identifying relevant information that highlights your professional qualifications.

2. **Job Description Parsing**:
   - The `JobDescriptionParser` class analyzes job descriptions to identify the required skills and qualifications. It decodes the text to extract critical elements that are necessary for each job role.

3. **Matching Algorithm**:
   - The `MatchingAlgorithm` class employs a vectorization technique to match your skills with the job requirements. By converting text into numerical vectors, it calculates the similarity between your resume and job descriptions to find the best matches.

4. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - The `RecommendationEngine` class takes the results from the matching algorithm to provide personalized job recommendations. It ranks job opportunities based on their relevance to your skills and experiences, helping you find the most suitable job openings.

Each component works together to create a powerful system that enhances your job search experience by focusing on accuracy and relevance.
